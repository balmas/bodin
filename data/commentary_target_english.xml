        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics (1177a)- “But
          if happiness consists in activity in accordance with virtue, it is reasonable that it
          should be activity in accordance with the highest virtue; and this will be the virtue of
          the best part of us. Whether then this be the intellect, or whatever else it be that is
          thought to rule and lead us by nature, and to have cognizance of what is noble and divine,
          either as being itself also actually divine, or as being relatively the divinest part of
          us, it is the activity of this part of us in accordance with the virtue proper to it that
          will constitute perfect happiness; and it has been stated already2 that this activity is
          the activity of contemplation. [2] And that happiness consists in contemplation may be
          accepted as agreeing both with the results already reached and with the truth. For
          contemplation is at once the highest form of activity (since the intellect is the highest
          thing in us, and the objects with which the intellect deals are the highest things that
          can be know), and also it is the most continuous, for we can reflect more continuously
          than we can carry on any form of action.” -

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Plato’s Phaedo (66b-67a)- “'There seems to be
          a short cut which leads us and our argument to the conclusion in our search that so long
          as we have the body, and the soul is contaminated by such an evil, we shall never attain
          completely what we desire, that is, the truth. For the body keeps us constantly busy by
          reason of its need of sustenance; and moreover, if diseases come upon it they hinder our
          pursuit of the truth. And the body fills us with passions and desires and fears, and all
          sorts of fancies and foolishness, so that, as they say, it really and truly makes it
          impossible for us to think at all. The body and its desires are the only cause of wars and
          factions and battles; for all wars arise for the sake of gaining money, and we are
          compelled to gain money for the sake of the body. We are slaves to its service. And so,
          because of all these things, we have no leisure for philosophy. But the worst of all is
          that if we do get a bit of leisure and turn to philosophy, the body is constantly breaking
          in upon our studies and disturbing us with noise and confusion, so that it prevents our
          beholding the truth, and in fact we perceive that, if we are ever to know anything
          absolutely, we must be free from the body and must behold the actual realities with the
          eye of the soul alone. And then, as our argument shows, when we are dead we are likely to
          possess the wisdom which we desire and claim to be enamored of, but not while we live.
          For, if pure knowledge is impossible while the body is with us, one of two thing must
          follow, either it cannot be acquired at all or only when we are dead; for then the soul
          will be by itself apart from the body, but not before. And while we live, we shall, I
          think, be nearest to knowledge when we avoid, so far as possible, intercourse and
          communion with the body, except what is absolutely necessary, and are not filled with its
          nature, but keep ourselves pure from it until God himself sets us free. And in this way,
          freeing ourselves from the foolishness of the body and being pure, we shall, I think, be
          with the pure and shall know of ourselves all that is pure…”

          avoidance of pleasures, while as to the laws of Cnosus—our friend Clinias, if he thinks
          fit, will defend them. The rules about pleasures at Sparta seem to me the best in the

          occasion for men to fall into excessive pleasures and riotous and follies of every
          description; neither in the country nor in the cities controlled by Spartiates is a
          drinking-club to be seen nor any of the practices which belong to such and foster to the
          utmost all kinds of pleasure. Indeed there is not a man who would not punish at once and
          most severely any drunken reveller he chanced to meet with, [637b] nor would even the
          feast of Dionysus serve as an excuse to save him—a revel such as I once upon a time
          witnessed “on the wagons”1 in your country; and at our colony of Tarentum, too, saw the
          whole city drunk at the Dionysia. But with us no such thing is possible.” -

          Antiquities (Book 1, Ch. 1, V, page 14)- “when they shall be convinced from this history,
          that Rome, even in her infancy, brought forth infinite examples of virtue, than which no
          city, either Greek, or Barbarian, ever produced greater for piety, justice, habitual
          temperance, and military accomplishments.” -
          https://archive.org/details/romanantiquities01dion Cicero’s De Officiis (1.62)- “But if
          the exaltation of spirit seen in times of danger and toil is devoid of justice and fights
          for selfish ends instead of for the common good, it is a vice; for not only has it no
          element of virtue, but its nature is barbarous and revolting to all our finer feelings.
          The Stoics, therefore, correctly define courage as ‘that virtue which champions the cause
          of right.’ Accordingly, no one has attained to true glory who has gained a reputation for
          courage by treachery and cunning; for nothing that lacks justice can be morally right.” -
