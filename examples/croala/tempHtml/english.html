    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">1    </span></p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">2    </span>Fierce terror and nocturnal concern were pressing upon my face</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">3    </span>and dreamy visions were agitating my soul.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">4    </span>After agonizing over an incoherent dream for a long time,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">5    </span>I pulled my weak limbs from an uncomfortable bed.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">6    </span>After this I set up an altar for a vow of atonement,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">7    </span>summoning the angry gods far above by putting forth the offering.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">8    </span>Then the Thessalian witch sprinkled consecrated water nine times around the bed,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">9    </span>then nine times on my forehead.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">10    </span>Woe is me, what have I seen! O Dream, I knew that you deceive,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">11    </span>but in deception, a careful lover is afraid of misfortunes.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">12    </span>If you want to show me such things again, not just out of</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">13    </span>my sight, but you yourself stay far away from your own eyes.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">14    </span>How much different is my love from others who love,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">15    </span>o wretched me: my love is unrestrained.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">16    </span>Love gives strength to others, for me it takes it away,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">17    </span>while loving, a gentle shadow moves me, but not even bitter death moves the
        others.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">18    </span>Under the leaves of trees, where the fluid frigidness</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">19    </span>of clear water weaves through dewy grass,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">20    </span>a cool breeze was moving scattered flowers,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">21    </span>and the idyllic riverside was echoing the songs of many birds.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">22    </span>It seemed that I was here catching the soft playing of a gentle</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">23    </span>Faun and subtle murmur of gurgling water,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">24    </span>when suddenly I see that my Lady is hidden under a secret ridge,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">25    </span>and that she is intertwined with a young man, but that man was not me.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">26    </span>How it hurts! O Dream, why do you hand her over to another's embrace,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">27    </span>the one who you could have put into my arms?</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">28    </span>Moreover, that man was Lycas! My insidious rival</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">29    </span>and the snake captivated by the love of my Lady.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">30    </span>Calmer, o Deianira, did Achelous, from a green cavern,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">31    </span>watch Hercules in your arms,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">32    </span>Calmer did the rage of Achilles observe, from Aeolus' ship,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">33    </span>Agemnemon in the arms of Briseis,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">34    </span>and faster do the snakes, faster does dreadful lust from a mountain</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">35    </span>of lions eliminate obstacles standing in its way,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">36    </span>than my weak liver swelled with bile,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">37    </span>while I was watching those things in a somber dream.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">38    </span>Meanwhile, the young man swiftly starts to capture</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">39    </span>his prey and reaches from both sides for her lustful hands.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">40    </span>What is within reach, he grabs, and the flaming passion spreads</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">41    </span>from lustful face through each of the girl's limbs.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">42    </span>And finally, now he wants to obtain the ultimate prize</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">43    </span>and to thrust his weapon into the defeated fortress.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">44    </span>Pure lust flows from his face, and from his eyes it shines,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">45    </span>while Aphrodite's passion grows red on tender cheeks.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">46    </span>Now, like a skilled wrestler in the middle of battleground,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">47    </span>he binds her neck, then seizes her legs,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">48    </span>now he unites his eyes with her eyes, now his lips with her lips,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">49    </span>now he touches the splendid fruit of her white thighs,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">50    </span>now he lures her by seduction, now with protests,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">51    </span>now he feigns resentment, now artfully begs.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">52    </span>She even fights, but not as though she wants to win,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">53    </span>nor does she hastily allow what she is afraid to restrain.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">54    </span>In truth, she runs away, as if she lures him by frolicking,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">55    </span>so that they savor the stolen kisses in the sweet escape.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">56    </span>The woman wants to be conquered, but does not want it to be seen that she wants
        it,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">57    </span>and though the man has more power, the woman has more wiles.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">58    </span>Woe is me, she neither uses her teeth, nor fierce nails,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">59    </span>at the same time she is not invoking vengeful gods.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">60    </span>She does not weep like Philomela did, after she was restrained</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">61    </span>by Thracian tyrant, by letting her hair down over her mournful face,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">62    </span>but she fights, as once the wise Spartan woman was fighting</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">63    </span>against tender love before the Trojan ships.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">64    </span>I was watching everything, and as I watch everything,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">65    </span>I was preparing all that a sudden fury is capable of.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">66    </span>My knife was intending to stain my hands with blood,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">67    </span>worse than wrathful Busiris and Cyclops.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">68    </span>Three times, in fact, I fought to dissolve the obnoxious game</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">69    </span>and to make an offering to my Furies with a dual killing,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">70    </span>three times I wanted to stand up, but rigid legs did not want</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">71    </span>to support he who wishes to go through the meadow.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">72    </span>While I am tossing the covers, and as I shake my body deliriously,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">73    </span>and my arms beat on the entire bed,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">74    </span>the dream, repelled, flees from my distressed face,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">75    </span>because that god does not like the restless.</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">76    </span>O good Jupiter, Cupid, who is bigger than your world, also bigger than you,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">77    </span>has ordered that you moo on the Sidonian plains,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">78    </span>o protector of the gods, though presiding</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">79    </span>at the forefront of everything, for whom fate hangs in submission to a woman's
        hand,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">80    </span>all that I have falsly seen,</p>
    <p class="tei_line"><span class="tei_lineNumber">81    </span>let Lycas, stunned, see as true in me!</p>
