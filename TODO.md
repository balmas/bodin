## Click Event Handling
Click event handling bugs are caused by overlapping note superscripts and overlapping alignment highlights.
This leads to multiple click event triggers and their resulting actions.
A click priority hierarchy needs to be developed and implemented.

## Alignment
Translation alignment is not accurate.  See BodinAlign._mark().
Maybe this isn't something that should be handled within the plugin.

## TEI to Bodin HTML
TEI needs to be transformed to Bodin HTML.
Tricky parts are splitting at milestones and pages.
